# Uncommon Dart Bug: Missing JSON Null Checks and Type Validation

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in Dart when handling JSON responses: missing null checks and type validation.  The `fetchData` function attempts to access the 'name' key directly without checking if it exists or if the data is in the expected format. This can lead to runtime exceptions if the JSON response is unexpected.

The solution demonstrates safe and robust ways to handle JSON data, incorporating null checks and type validation for a more resilient application.
